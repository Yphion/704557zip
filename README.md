704557zip is a free and open-source file archiver, a utility used to extract groups of files from compressed containers known as "archives".
It is a slightly modified version of the python zifpile class.

704557zip allows to extract files from archives which cannot be extracted using the common zip tools.

1. Place the 704557zip directory DIRECTLY on your Desktop in order to prevent any permission issues.
2. Locate the archive you want to extract.
3. Drag the archive on the 704557zip.bat in order to extract it.
4. Open the Output directory in the 704557zip directory.
5. Locate your extracted archive.

Note 1: DO NOT edit the batch file. DO NOT edit the python file. Edits may lead to sever system damage. All lines are INTENDED.

Note 2: Follow the instructions above to avoid running into unexpected errors.

Note 3: Do not extract the same archive twice OR empty the output directory before you do so.

Note 4: DO NOT use 704557zip on archives from untrusted sources.

Note 5: DO NOT ignore Note 1 and DO NOT try to circumvent it by any means.
